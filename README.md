# INET3101 Lab 1

## Code for INET 3101 Lab 1

Simple command-line menu for an Inventory Management System

(Will assume that we can put the README.txt info here)

### Who wrote the program (ensure all members are listed in the doc):

- Leng Thao

### Program description paragraph:

- Essentially a Parts Inventory Manager where we have 6 functions that allows you to display records or
add/delete records and more.
- It also has a 7th function for quitting/leaving the program.

### Menu definition and usage

- Displays a menu of options where users can choose from. It'll get the user input and execute 
an action based on that choice.
- It will also keep on looping until the user ends the program. 

### Each function defined with Input type(s) (if any), Output type, Algorithm description

- Most are void functions, meaning they return nothing but are used in this case to print/notify that the function is working. 
- However the printNumChange has an argument to it which tells us what the user has decided to do (Also used 
within the choosing an option part of the program).

### Listing of files required and what type they are (.h header, .c c code, etc..)

- lab1.c (The program itself)
